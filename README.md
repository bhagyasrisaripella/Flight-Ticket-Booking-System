# Flight-Ticket-Booking-System
A Flight Ticket Booking System is a software application that allows users to search, book, and manage flight tickets online. It helps both customers and airlines to efficiently handle ticket reservations.
The flight ticket booking system is a console-based application designed to simplify the booking and cancellation of flight tickets for passengers. It provides a menu-driven interface where users can select flights to three predefined destinations—Vizag, Rajahmundry, and Bengaluru—manage seat availability, calculate total costs including luggage charges based on weight, and confirm bookings only if seats are available. The system also includes a cancellation feature that uses user details and a reference ID to process refund requests. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, input/output operations, and basic arithmetic within the airline reservation
